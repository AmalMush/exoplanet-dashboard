# 🌌 Exoplanet Habitability Explorer

This interactive dashboard allows users to explore NASA exoplanet data and predict potential habitability using a machine learning model.  
Built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, the app filters planets based on radius, insolation flux, and stellar temperature, and lets you apply a trained ML model for habitability prediction.

## 🔍 Features
- Slider-based filters for planet and star properties
- ML toggle to predict habitability
- Search by KOI name
- Download filtered data
- Plot radius vs. insolation flux
